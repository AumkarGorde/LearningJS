    <h1>Javascript : var : const : let</h1> 
    <ol>
        <li><b>var</b></li>
            <dl>
                <dt>Function-Scoped</dt>
                <dd>Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means they are visible and accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>Hoisting</dt>
                <dd>Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means you can use them before they are declared, but they will have an initial value of undefined.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>Reassignment</dt>
                <dd>Variables declared with var can be reassigned.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <label for="numberforvar">Enter a number:</label>
                <input type="number" id="numberforvar" min="0" required>
                <button onclick="demovar()">Check</button>

        <li><b>let</b></li>
            <dl>
                <dt>Block-Scoped</dt>
                <dd>Variables declared with let are block-scoped. They are limited in visibility to the block, statement, or expression where they are declared.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>Hoisting</dt>
                <dd>Variables declared with let are hoisted, but unlike var, they are not initialized. Attempting to use them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>Reassignment</dt>
                <dd>Variables declared with let can be reassigned.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <label for="numberforlet">Enter a number:</label>
                <input type="number" id="numberforlet" min="0" required>
                <button onclick="demolet()">Check</button>
                <p id="resultlet"></p>
            </dl>
        <li><b>const</b></li>
            <dl>
                <dt>Block-Scoped</dt>
                <dd>Like let, variables declared with const are block-scoped.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>Hoisting</dt>
                <dd> Variables declared with const are hoisted, but they are not initialized. Attempting to use them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>Immutable</dt>
                <dd> Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after declaration. However, if the variable holds an object or array, the properties or elements of that object or array can still be modified.</dd>
            </dl>
    </ol>   
    <b4> 
    <ol>
        <li>Use const when you have a variable that should never be reassigned after its initial assignment. This is particularly useful for constants and values that should remain unchanged.</li>
        <li>Use let when you need to reassign a variable or when you want to limit its scope to a specific block.</li>
        <li><b>Avoid using var</b> in modern JavaScript unless you have a specific need for function-scoped variables or you're dealing with older code that relies on var. let and const are generally preferred for better scoping and error handling.</li>
