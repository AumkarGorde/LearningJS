In Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you can quickly create an HTML template using the built-in Emmet abbreviations. 
Here's a common shortcut to generate a basic HTML template:

Open VS Code.
In an HTML file or an empty text document, type html:5.
Press the Tab key.

In HTML, when you include a `<script>` tag with the `defer` attribute like this:

<script src="app.js" defer></script>

The `defer` attribute tells the browser to load and parse the external JavaScript file (`app.js` in this case) but to defer 
its execution until after the HTML content has been fully parsed and displayed.

Here's what happens when you use `defer`:

1. The browser starts downloading `app.js` immediately when it encounters the `<script>` tag but continues parsing the HTML.

2. Once the HTML parsing is complete and the DOM (Document Object Model) is built, the browser will execute the deferred script. 
   This ensures that the JavaScript code in `app.js` doesn't block the rendering of the HTML.

3. Deferred scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML document, so if you have multiple scripts with the `defer` attribute, 
   they will be executed in the order they are encountered.

Using `defer` is a good practice when you want to include JavaScript at the end of your HTML document but still want to make sure it's executed after the HTML structure is ready. 
This can lead to faster initial page rendering and better user experience.
